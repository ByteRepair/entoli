# Sync: paired devices, live mirrors, remote control

Two Entoli devices pair over a QR or typed code, open a WebRTC data channel
between them, and one mirrors the other's chats or drives them remotely.
Commands always run on the chat's home device; control moves only who
types/prompts/approves.

## The threat model and how it is answered

| Threat | Answer |
|---|---|
| Passive eavesdropping (Wi-Fi, ISP) | DTLS (mandatory in WebRTC, no opt-out) + app-layer ChaCha20-Poly1305 on every message. Defense in depth: a libwebrtc regression leaks nothing readable. |
| Malicious signaling relay / TURN | Relays shuttle opaque ciphertext. After the handshake everything is AEAD — chat records, titles, even signaling envelopes — under keys the relay never sees. |
| MITM during pairing | The pairing secret travels out-of-band (QR / typed code, 128-bit). The handshake mixes it into HKDF over the full transcript (psk, both ephemeral X25519 keys, both Ed25519 identity keys). Both screens show the resulting SAS; an altered key changes it visibly. |
| Impersonation on reconnect | Each device has a persistent Ed25519 keypair. Peer keys are pinned in `devices.json`; reconnects verify the peer's identity via signed transcript and `requirePeerId` refuses a different key. |
| Stolen/replayed pairing payload | Pairing secrets are single-use for fresh pairs; reconnect tokens are derived per-pair. Channel keys are per-connection via ephemeral X25519. |
| Message injection/replay/ordering | AEAD nonces are monotonic per-direction counters; a replayed or reordered frame fails its MAC. Role enforcement at dispatch disconnects on violation. |
| Compromised paired device | Devices are individually revocable. Mirrors are RAM-only on the viewing device — never written to the data dir, so never in backups or IndexedDB. |

Key hygiene: secrets never enter logs, errors, or `conv.jsonl`. The first wire
message is the handshake itself — no plaintext `hello` before it.

## The handshake

`handshake.dart` runs over a fresh `ByteChannel` before any application
message. Three plaintext messages:

    initiator -> joiner  {"v","role":"i","id","pk","eph","name"}
    joiner -> initiator  {"v","role":"j", ...same..., "sig"}
    initiator -> joiner  {"v","role":"i","sig"}

Both sides sign the transcript (both ephemeral keys, both identity keys, in
fixed role order) with their Ed25519 identity key. Channel keys are
HKDF-SHA256 over the X25519 shared secret and the pairing secret; the pairing
secret never crossed the network. The SAS (six base32 characters, forty bits)
is derived beside the keys for human confirmation.

The handshake initiator is always the WebRTC *answer* side (`!weOffered`),
so whichever route brought the two together needs no extra message to decide
who speaks first.

## The framing layer

`framing.dart` wraps a `ByteChannel` in ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD. Every frame:

    [type: 1 byte][counter: 4 bytes BE][AEAD(cleartext)]

Counters are per-direction and monotonic — a replayed, reordered or spliced
frame fails its MAC. The type byte (control or binary) is associated data, so
a control message can never be mistaken for a resource chunk. `SecureChannel`
exposes `sendJson` / `jsonIncoming` for the NDJSON control protocol and
`sendBinary` for 16KB resource chunks.

## Three rendezvous transports

1. **Same-LAN** (`signaling_server.dart`): HTTP server binding `0.0.0.0` on an
   ephemeral port, serving CORS + Private-Network-Access preflights. QR
   carries `{hosts, port, one-time code, psk}`. The joiner POSTs its offer;
   the host answers in the same response.
2. **Internet relay** (`relay_signaler.dart`): both sides dial a user-supplied
   `wss://` URL and join the same room — derived from the pairing secret's
   SHA-256, so the relay learns nothing. A reference relay is
   `tool/sync_relay_server.dart`.
3. **Manual copy-paste**: the SDP rides in the pairing blob itself, pasted
   through a human. Universal fallback; the only route that works with no
   network beyond the data channel's own ICE.

Web builds are relay/manual-paste only — a browser cannot bind a socket, and
HTTPS Pages makes plain-http LAN dialing mixed-content-blocked.

## The SyncHub

`sync_hub.dart` owns the three decisions above the wire:

- **Who speaks first.** Handshake initiator = `!weOffered`, per route.
- **Who may dial again.** A pairing window arms its one-time code; every
  completed pair also arms a reconnect token derived from the pair's secret,
  so paired devices redial without re-pairing while the app's server is up.
- **What the relay learns.** Nothing readable. Rooms are derived from pairing
  secrets; SDP blobs are opaque; channel keys come from material that never
  crossed any network.

`SyncHub` lives in `AppSession`, torn down in `dispose` beside the sweep and
the backend. It is built in `main` after the config and store, reads settings
through a closure deferred to the container, and is injected via
`syncHubProvider` (throw-unimplemented, overridden in main, faked in tests).

## Secrets at rest

`SecretStore` is the interface; the port picks the implementation:

- **Linux**: `KeyringSecretStore` over the FreeDesktop Secret Service API
  (`freedesktop_secret`), items labelled "Entoli — sync identity" and
  "Entoli — paired devices". Falls back to `FileSecretStore` where no service
  answers (headless, minimal WM, the dev toolbox).
- **Android**: `FileSecretStore` under app-private storage — already out of
  every other app's reach — until Keystore wiring lands.
- **Web**: `FileSecretStore` in origin-scoped IndexedDB. The weakest of the
  three; the Sync page says so rather than pretending otherwise.

`encrypted` says which a build got; the settings page warns on `false` and
nothing else here cares, because every caller wants the same three verbs.

## Data dir layout

```
<dataDir>/sync/identity.json   # public: device id, name, public key
<dataDir>/sync/devices.json    # public: paired peers, addresses, last seen
<dataDir>/sync/secrets.json    # private: only where no keyring answered
```

Backups skip `sync/` entirely (`writeBackup` passes `skipDir` to `archiveOf`):
a backup must not carry private keys, and a restore wipes the data directory
first — so `sync/` in a backup would silently unpair this device on every
restore. The identity key itself lives in the keyring where there is one, not
in `identity.json`, which holds only public facts.

No migration entry: the chain is additive and nothing existing moved.
