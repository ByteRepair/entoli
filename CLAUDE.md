# Entoli

Flutter (Linux/Web/Android) ChatGPT-style UI over a coding agent. Client-side:
it calls the user's own LLM endpoints and runs commands on their machine.

The app is named Entoli; most of the identifiers are not, and deliberately.
The data directory is still `~/.config/agent-chat`, the env var is still
`AGENT_CHAT_CONFIG`, and the Dart package is still `agent_chat`. Renaming any
of those would leave the chats already written where nothing reads them, for a
string nobody sees.

The one identifier that did move is the application id, from the placeholder
`com.agentchat.agent_chat` to `io.github.yiannis128.agent_chat` — the first was
a reverse-DNS name for a domain nobody here owns. Android and GTK both refuse a
hyphen in an id, so the last segment is `agent_chat` rather than `agent-chat`.
It is the Android `applicationId` and `namespace` and the Linux
`APPLICATION_ID`, all one string. Changing it makes this a different app to
Android, which is only free before a release; it is why the Kotlin package
moved with it.

## Architecture

One backend, `MinisweBackend` — mini-swe-agent's loop ported to Dart and running
in this process. No server, no Python, nothing to install. `AgentBackend` stays
as an interface so the UI and repository can be tested against `FakeBackend`.

- `conv.json` is the source of truth. `ChatController` accumulates a turn's
  events into it as they arrive; `ChatRepository` resolves which model runs and
  owns rewinding. Context is re-injected only when a turn is resent — otherwise
  the agent's own session carries it.
- The agent runs **on top of** Entoli. Commands and agents are Entoli's,
  expanded before the agent sees them.

### On-disk layout

`<dataDir>/chats/<chat-id>/` with `state.json`, `conv.json`, `meta.json`,
`resources/`, `workspace/`, and `<dataDir>/workspace/` beside them.
`<dataDir>/projects/<project>/` holds `chats/` and `workspace/` of its own.
`<dataDir>/commands/*.md` and `<dataDir>/agents/*.md` are the user's own prompt
files, beside `settings.json` — which holds the app-level model default, the
title model, the classifier model, `approveMode`, `environment`, `appIcon`, and
`llmProviders`.
Data dir: `$AGENT_CHAT_CONFIG` if set, else `~/.config/agent-chat` (desktop),
app-private storage (Android). A browser has none of this, and `dart:io`
compiles for the web — it is the calls that throw — so nothing says so at build
time.

`Storage` is where that is answered: `dataDir`, `ensureDir`, `read`, `write`,
and two implementations, `DiskStorage` and `MemoryStorage`. `AppConfig` is
built on one and does no I/O of its own — it composes path names, and whether
they lead anywhere is the port's business. That is also where the data
directory is resolved, since "where does this platform keep things" is the same
question: `MemoryStorage` answers `/agent-chat` and remembers what is written
there for the life of the page. `AppConfig.load` reading `Platform.environment`
before there was a port is what left the web build a white screen.

Chats are not in it. They are a `ChatStore`, a whole store rather than three
calls, and `MemoryChatStore` holds in fields what `LocalChatStore` holds in
files. Prompts are the same shape: `platformPromptSources` offers the presets
alone where there is no directory to have written one in. Both are chosen in
`core/platform/` (see "Running the commands"), so neither `LocalChatStore` nor
`DirectoryPrompts` is part of the web program at all, and neither has to know a
browser exists.

The port is what makes the no-filesystem path testable off a browser:
`storage_test.dart` runs the settings round trip over a `MemoryStorage` on the
VM, which is otherwise reachable only by loading the app in a tab.
`ChatMeta.fromFile` and `LocalChatStore` still use `dart:io` directly, on
purpose — the disk store is allowed to be the disk store, and listing,
renaming and recursive delete are not going in a port that exists for four
calls.

### Projects

A project is a directory holding its own chats and one workspace they share.
The default project is `null`, and it **is** the data directory — so every chat
written before there were projects is already in it, and nothing had to be
moved. `AppConfig`'s path helpers all take `{String? project}` for that reason:
passing nothing means the default project and the layout that was there before.

Two workspaces reach a turn, and they answer different questions. The chat's own
(`chats/<id>/workspace/`) is the working directory of every command and is not
shared with anything. The project's (`<project>/workspace/`) is named in the
system prompt as where work another conversation should find goes. The agent
writes to it by path; it is deliberately not the cwd, because a turn's scratch
files would then be everyone's.

`ChatStore` is addressed by chat id alone, so `LocalChatStore` is what knows
where a chat is: `_locate` answers from a cache that `list` fills, and falls
back to looking for the id under each project. It returns a record rather than a
name because "in the default project" and "nowhere yet" are both `null` and mean
opposite things to a save. Where a chat already is wins over what its
`ChatState.project` says — a UI copy held from before a move must not write the
chat back where it used to be — and the field only decides where a chat that is
nowhere yet goes. Reading is the same rule: `list` and `load` stamp each chat
with the directory it came out of, so one moved by hand is in the project it was
moved to.

`ChatRepository.sendPrompt` resolves the project the way it resolves the model,
and it travels to the backend as a `sendPrompt` parameter. A draft answers for
itself: it is not on disk to be found, and its first turn can be sent before
anything has written it.

The sidebar shows one project at a time. `chatListProvider` holds every chat, in
every project — the store reads them all in one pass — and the sidebar filters
on `selectedProjectProvider`, which is also where a new chat goes. Switching
projects clears the selected chat, since it is no longer in the list.

A project name is a directory name, so `projectNameFrom` makes what was typed
safe to be one — the model writes paths into it — and `AppConfig.projectDir`
refuses anything that is not one segment under `projects/`, since every
project-scoped path is built through it. `isProjectName` is the same rule read
the other way: a directory that could not have been created as a project is not
listed as one, so a stray `.git` beside them is not a project with no chats in
it.

### Starting a chat, and naming it

`createChat` writes nothing. The chat is held in `ChatRepository` as its one
draft — with whatever `meta.json` would have held, since writing that would
create the directory a draft does without — and reaches the store the first
time `save` is called, which is the first message. The sidebar lists what the
store holds, so a chat nobody said anything in leaves nothing behind.
`ChatController` invalidates `chatListProvider` after that first save and after
a rename, which are the only two things that change what the sidebar shows;
refreshing it on every message would re-read every chat off disk to draw the
same list.

A chat is created as "New chat" and stays that way unless a **title LLM** is
configured. When one is, `ChatRepository` sends the first message to it through
`AgentBackend.ask` — one call, no tools, no session, not the agent — and
`cleanTitle` cuts the answer down to a title. Nothing waits on it: it is asked
while the turn runs, and it lands through `retitle`, which writes `state.json`
alone because the turn is still adding to `conv.json`. A model that cannot
answer names nothing and the chat keeps the name it has; there is no turn to
report that on.

`ask` is the capability, not the feature: the backend is the only route to a
provider, so a one-shot question belongs on it, while the prompt and the
clean-up are `lib/domain/chat_title.dart` and the repository composes them.

`cleanTitle` exists because the reply names the chat verbatim. Every rule in it
is one of the prompt's instructions being ignored — a quoted title, a `Title:`
prefix, an explanation on the next line, thirty words instead of twenty.

### The agent loop

`MinisweAgent` is mini-swe-agent's control flow in Dart: render the system and
task prompts, ask the model, run the tool calls it made, show it the results,
repeat. It exits when the model replies with no tool calls — the reply text is
the answer — or when it hits the step limit. This is the native API contract
models are trained on (text-only message = finished answer, tool calls =
continue), which works reliably across model sizes. The codebase previously
used mini-swe-agent's `COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT` marker as the
termination signal, but that protocol was a forcing function for weak models on
SWE-bench and failed on exactly the small models this app targets: they called
the marker without writing answer text, leaving the sub-agent runner with an
empty buffer.

Ported rather than embedded because none of the ways of running the real Python
meet "no external setup": `flutter_python_bridge` shells out to the system
`python3` on desktop, Chaquopy is Android-only, Pyodide is web-only, and
litellm — how upstream reaches a provider at all — has native dependencies none
of them can build. The loop is about a hundred lines of actual logic; the model
clients are the large half of the work.

The prompts live in `templates.dart`, adapted from upstream's `mini.yaml` for a
conversation: upstream runs one task and exits, this is asked something else
once the turn is over. A turn's prose streams into the bubble as `TextDelta`,
its commands become tool labels, and a no-tool-call reply ends the turn.

One thing the prompt has to say explicitly, learned from watching a real model
fail: that a command only runs when the `bash` tool is called (a model shown a
fenced ```` ```echo foo``` ```` will imitate the fence and write the line as
prose, which does nothing). Finishing is native — the model just replies with
text and no tool call — so no marker instruction is needed.

Every tool call gets an answer, including the ones never run — after an abort,
for a tool that does not exist. A provider that sees a
`tool_use` with no matching result rejects the *next* turn, so padding them with
"this command was not executed" is what keeps the session usable.

`MinisweSession` holds the conversation as the model sees it, per chat, for as
long as the app runs. `resetSession` seeds a fresh one with a transcript.

#### Reaching a provider

`LlmClient` has two implementations: `OpenAiClient` (`/chat/completions` — and
so also OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama Cloud, ollama, LM Studio, vLLM) and
`AnthropicClient` (`/messages`). Anthropic is not reachable through the first
one: its system prompt is a parameter rather than a message, tool results ride
inside user turns, and consecutive results have to be folded into one turn
because a turn holding N `tool_use` blocks must be answered by exactly one turn
holding all N results.

Thinking is handed back with the `signature` it arrived with. With thinking
enabled, Anthropic rejects a tool-use turn whose thinking was dropped, so
`LlmMessage` carries `reasoningSignature` for no other reason. Enabling
thinking also pins the temperature at 1, so the two are never sent together.

Providers are configured in `settings.json` under `llmProviders` — id, API
shape, base URL, key, and an optional model list — and `llmProviderPresets`
fills in the endpoints worth naming so that adding one is a key rather than a
URL nobody remembers. A key can be left out and named as `apiKeyEnv` instead,
which is how one already exported stays out of the file. `LlmRegistry` builds a
client per provider and rebuilds it when the URL or key changes; a provider that
lists no models is asked, and one that cannot answer contributes nothing rather
than failing the whole list.

A `RateLimitGate` is built per turn in `MinisweBackend.sendPrompt` and shared by
the parent `MinisweAgent` and every sub-agent it spawns: it bounds in-flight
`LlmClient.stream` calls to `MinisweOptions.maxConcurrentLlmRequests` (4
default) through a `GatedLlmClient` wrapper, and coordinates 429 backoff so a
75-vote fan-out doesn't each-retry-into the same rate limit. When any one
request gets a 429, the gate sets a shared cooldown that every other in-flight
or queued request honours; backoff grows exponentially across successive 429
episodes (1s → 2s → 4s → … → 60s cap) and resets on any successful request. The
gate is distinct from `maxConcurrentSubAgents` (8), which bounds long-lived
agent parallelism — one sub-agent makes up to `stepLimit` calls. Null for agents
built against a raw client (tests), where the per-agent retry path governs.

#### Errors, and how long the UI waits

Failures are reported as they happen: a rejected key or a bad request reaches
`ErrorEvent` on the first attempt, and a retryable one (429, 5xx, a connection
that never opened) emits `RetryEvent` the instant it fails. Four attempts with
1s/2s/4s backoff means a persistent 5xx or connection error is reported after
~7s. A 429 takes a different path: a `RateLimitGate` shared across the parent
and every sub-agent coordinates backoff so a fan-out pauses as one rather than
each-retry-into the same limit (see "Reaching a provider"). 429 retries
continue for `MinisweOptions.rateLimitRetryBudget` (5 min default) with
exponential backoff capped at 60s; other retryables keep the per-agent
`maxAttempts` budget. Where no gate is present (tests against a raw
`FakeLlmClient`), 429s fall back to the per-agent path.

Because nothing is hidden, silence only ever means work, and the UI never
gives up on a turn on its own — the user cancels. A `RetryEvent` is
turn-scoped view state, never a message part, so it is not persisted.

#### Running the commands

What the app is given by the platform it runs on — a shell or none, the network
or CORS, a filesystem or a page's memory — is resolved in
`lib/core/platform/platform.dart`, which holds the app's single conditional
import (`io/platform.dart` or `web/platform.dart`) and is otherwise plain
wiring: `LocalShell`, `DuckDuckGoSearch`, `DiskStorage`, `LocalChatStore` and
the user's own prompt directory on desktop and Android; `UnavailableShell`,
`UnavailableWebSearch`, `MemoryStorage`, `MemoryChatStore` and the presets
alone in a browser.
One import site is the point: an implementation a platform cannot use is not
reachable from its program, so nothing further down has to test for it.

`MinisweBackend.webSearch` is required rather than defaulted for that reason —
a default of `DuckDuckGoSearch()` puts its HTML parser in the web bundle
(~280 KB) where CORS means it can never be called.

`Shell.canRunCommands` is what a browser actually changes, and it is not one
failing command — it is the whole loop. With no shell there is nothing to run,
so `bashTool` is dropped from the request and a system prompt with no tool
instructions is used; the turn ends when the model replies with text and no
tool call, the same termination signal the shell path uses.

`LocalShell` prepends `exec 2>&1` to the script rather than merging two Dart
streams — a compiler's errors interleaved with its progress is the whole value
of reading them, and separate pipes arrive in whatever order they flush. It
spawns under `setsid` where that exists so a timeout can kill the process
group: a timed-out `npm install` that only loses its shell keeps downloading.
Whether `setsid` is there is learned by trying it, not by probing first.

#### Approvals

`approveMode` (`meta.json` over `settings.json`) is resolved once in
`ChatRepository` and arrives with the prompt, so it is a `MinisweAgent`
parameter beside `approve` rather than part of `MinisweOptions`, which holds
only what is genuinely per-agent. Three modes: `ask` (every command waits for
the banner), `auto` (a classifier model decides allow/ask/deny per command),
`never` (run everything). An older file's `approveCommands` bool migrates:
`true` → `ask`, `false` → `never`.

In `auto` mode, a `PermissionClassifier` (the `LlmClassifier` impl, or
`NoClassifier` when no classifier model is configured) is asked before each
`bash` and `webfetch` call. `allow` runs silently, `deny` refuses with a
message, `ask` escalates to the same banner `ask` mode uses. A circuit
breaker pauses auto mode after 3 consecutive or 20 total escalations in one
turn, falling back to `ask` for the rest — emitted as an `InfoEvent` so the
UI can say "auto mode paused." `NoClassifier` always asks, which is why the
default mode is `ask` and `auto` is disabled in the settings UI until a
classifier model is picked. `never` is labeled "(DANGEROUS)" in the dropdown.

The `ApprovalRequestEvent` is emitted *before* the agent waits on it, because
the banner is where the answer comes from. The completer is therefore created
when the event is forwarded, not when it is awaited, and an answer completes it
in place rather than removing it — a user who clicks faster than the loop asks
would otherwise leave it waiting on a completer nobody holds. A turn that ends
with one outstanding denies it.

#### Questions

`ask_user` is the one tool that runs nothing: the model puts questions to the
user and the turn waits. Offered with or without a shell — a browser cannot
run a command, but it can still ask — which is why `_tools` exists and
`unknownTool` is told what was on offer rather than assuming `bash`.

The call and its answers are an ordinary call/result pair, so `conv.json` keeps
them with no new part type in it, a rewind carries them like anything else, and
the chat draws an answered question back out of what was persisted. `AskLabel`
is that: the question on a label, the answers behind the drawer, parsed once and
kept — every visible message is rebuilt on every streamed delta. What it draws is
decided by what parsed, not by the name that got it there: a call named
`ask_user` with nothing askable in it falls back to `ToolLabel`, which shows the
rejection the model was sent.

Answering is `_answer`, one tool message per call — the invariant that keeps the
next turn from being rejected. `_answerRun` is that plus the wording a command's
outcome gets, which is every call but an `ask_user`.

`lib/domain/ask.dart` holds both directions of the format, `askAnswers` beside
`askAnswersFrom`, so the round trip is one file. `askQuestionsFrom` is
deliberately liberal: the arguments are the model's writing, not ours, so it may
batch under `questions` or write one question out at the top level, and it
reaches for whichever word its prompt left in its head — `angles`, `choices`,
`query` for a value. A question with no options is the one thing rejected,
because the panel answers by clicking and there would be nothing to click. Every
question comes back to the model whether or not it was answered: one that asked
three and got two needs to know which one it is still missing.

`QuestionPanel` takes the composer's place while a request is up — including its
stop button, which is why `Skip` is on the panel: it answers with nothing so the
turn can carry on, and it is the only way out. The rest mirrors approvals
exactly: turn-scoped view state, `_clearQuestions` beside `_clearApprovals` so an
abandoned turn answers its own questions, the completer created when the event is
forwarded rather than when it is awaited.

#### Sub-agents (the `task` tool)

`task` spawns a sub-agent with its own session under the named `@agent`'s
prompt, runs it to completion headless, and returns its final text as the tool
result. The sub-agent shares the parent's model, shell, and workspace, but
sees nothing of the parent's conversation — the prompt is its whole task. It
has no `task` (sub-agents do not fan out), no `ask_user` (nobody answers), and
runs under `ApproveMode.never`: a fan-out of 75 voters is not usable if each
one stops on a banner.

`SubAgentRunner` holds the running agents so `cancel` reaches them — a turn
aborted while sub-agents are running kills every one, not just the parent's
loop. The parent's `_executeTasks` runs the calls concurrently, capped by
`MinisweOptions.maxConcurrentSubAgents` (8 by default — deep-research can fan
out to 75, and 8 concurrent keeps provider rate limits in view). Events
stream out as each sub-agent resolves, but the session messages are answered
in the calls' original order, so the tool results pair up with the calls.

Non-`task` calls in the same message run first, in order, so a command before
the fan-out is done before it starts and one after waits for it. The
alternative — interleaving a sub-agent with a command it might depend on —
would race the two.

`SubAgentStartEvent` / `SubAgentEndEvent` are turn-scoped view state (like
approvals and questions), so `conv.json` keeps the call/result pair and
nothing more; a reloaded chat draws a `TaskLabel` from the call's arguments
alone. `SubAgentStrip` shows the running ones as chips above the composer.

#### Web search (the `websearch` / `webfetch` tools)

`websearch` queries DuckDuckGo Lite — no API key — and returns titles, URLs,
and snippets. `webfetch` is a plain GET with markup stripped to text. Both
are read-only, so they run without an approval banner in every mode — the
classifier gates `webfetch` (it reaches a URL the model chose) but not
`websearch` (it reads a search engine's answer to a query).

`WebSearch` is the interface, like `Shell` for commands: `DuckDuckGoSearch`
on desktop and Android, `UnavailableWebSearch` on the web platform (CORS
blocks cross-origin requests from a browser). `Shell.canRunCommands` gates
`bash`; `WebSearch.available` gates `websearch`/`webfetch` the same way —
offered where there is something to reach, dropped where there is not. The
search page is HTML, not JSON, so results are parsed out of the table it
renders. Both return a `ShellResult`, so the agent words a search's outcome
the same way it words a command's — the model reads one shape, whatever ran.

#### Live test

`test/live/miniswe_live.dart` drives a real provider through the production
path. It deliberately does **not** call
`TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`: that installs an
`HttpOverrides` answering every request with a 400, which is the whole of what a
live test is for. That rules out `rootBundle`, so it copies `assets/prompts/`
off disk instead of using `BundledPrompts`. Not a `_test.dart` file, so
`flutter test` skips it.

### Thinking and tool runs

A turn is not just a reply: the model thinks, runs tools, thinks again. Each of
those is a part of the assistant message and the chat draws it as a frameless
label above the bubble, in the order it happened, with the detail behind a
bottom drawer. The bubble holds only what the model said.

`durationMs` is what the label reads ("Thought for 12 seconds") and is null
while the block is still being written — which is also how the UI knows to say
"Thinking…", and how the controller finds the block a delta or a close belongs
to. It searches for that open block rather than assuming it is the last part: a
provider that interleaves parts can start a tool between a block's deltas and
the event closing it, and assuming the last part wrote the thinking twice. A
block that was never timed — an older conversation, an aborted turn — is still
worth opening, so it reads "View thinking". `ReasoningEnd` carries the whole
text as well as the duration, so a provider that streams no deltas still fills
the block.

`ReasoningPart` is not a `TextPart`, so `plainText` leaves it out: a rewound
session is seeded with what was said, never with what was thought.

A tool call and the result answering it are one label. The parts stay separate
in `conv.json` (they arrive at different times) and the UI pairs them by
`callID`; a result whose call is gone draws its own.

### Commands and agents

`PromptLibrary` is the whole of what the composer's `/` and `@` menus offer,
built once at startup from two `PromptSource`s in precedence order: the presets
packaged under `assets/prompts/{commands,agents}/`, then
`$AGENT_CHAT_CONFIG/{commands,agents}/`. A file the user wrote replaces the
preset it shares a name with. Entries come back sorted by name, so the menu does
not reorder when a source does. Built once because reading assets is async and
nothing downstream should wait on it; a file added while the app runs therefore
does not appear until a restart, though nothing would break if it did — the
agent looks documents up per turn.

A prompt file is YAML frontmatter, then the template a command expands to or the
system prompt an agent runs under. `PromptDocument` reads only the top-level
scalars — `description` is all the menu needs.

The syntax is parsed in `MinisweBackend` (`_command` / `_mention`), not in the
repository or the UI: `conv.json` stores the message as typed, so a regenerated
turn re-parses to the same thing. `activeCompletionToken` in the composer has to
agree with those two patterns — anything the menu offers has to dispatch.

`/name args` expands to the command's body with `$ARGUMENTS` substituted (or
appended); a name the library does not know is left alone, because it is more
likely a path. `@name` stacks that agent's prompt under the system message.

`completions` is therefore **not** on `AgentBackend`: `completionsProvider`
reads the library directly and is synchronous.

### Resending a message

Edit and regenerate discard the turn and everything after it, then re-run it.
The live session still holds the discarded exchange, so `resetSession` drops it
and seeds a fresh one with `transcriptOf` the kept messages. This is the one
place where the "conv.json is the source of truth, re-inject context" rule is
actually exercised. The transcript names the files the kept messages carried
rather than resending them: only the turn being replayed carries its own back.

### Attachments

The `+` button offers Image and File. Both open the same chooser and differ only
in its filter, so they share one path: `AttachmentPicker` (a domain interface,
`file_selector` behind it, faked in tests) hands back `Attachment`s of filename,
mime type and bytes.

Bytes are saved under the chat's `resources/` and the message keeps a `FilePart`
naming the resource. That is what makes an edit or a regenerate work: the parts
are in `conv.json`, so a resend reads the bytes back off disk rather than
needing the composer to still hold them. `saveAttachments` leaves one that
already has a resource where it is, so replaying a turn does not copy its bytes
again.

The store's resource I/O is async where the rest of it is sync: a JSON file is
small enough to write on the UI thread, an attachment is not. A widget test's
clock is fake and never advances real I/O, which is what `pumpUntil` in
`test/harness.dart` is for.

### The app icon

Two icons, `AppIcon.prompt` (the default) and `AppIcon.cookie`. Each exists
several times over, because each platform wants its own form and they are
checked in rather than built: `assets/icons/*.svg` is what the app draws,
`drawable/ic_<name>_{foreground,monochrome}` over the shared
`ic_icon_background` are the Android adaptive layers named by
`mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_<name>.xml`, and `web/icons/` is the PWA set. Android
reads no SVG, so its copies are the same path data as a vector drawable, and
editing one means editing all of them — there is no generator.

`minSdk` is pinned to 26 rather than following `flutter.minSdkVersion`, which
is 24. Adaptive icons start at 26; below it every icon needs a full set of
rasters at five densities as well, which was ten files existing only for
Android 7.x. Pinning it is also what let the pre-Lollipop
`drawable/launch_background.xml` go — the `-v21` one it shadowed reads the
theme background instead of hardcoding white, so the splash follows dark mode.

The monochrome layer is not decoration: a themed icon is the silhouette tinted
from the wallpaper, so an icon whose meaning lives in its colour has none there.
The background is one file for both icons rather than one each, since both sit
on the same flat indigo.

`<application android:icon>` points at `@mipmap/ic_prompt`, the default icon's
own resource, rather than a copy under a name of its own — the app-info icon
then gets the adaptive form too, and there is one fewer image to keep in step.

`appIcon` is app-level and has no per-chat override — an icon is the app's, not
a conversation's.

Changing it is two writes, and only one of them is the app's. `setAppIcon`
saves the setting first and then tells the launcher, because the setting is what
`AppMark` draws from: a launcher that refuses still leaves the app showing what
was picked. Android is the only platform where the launcher can be told
anything at all; everywhere else `LauncherIcons.available` is false, the
settings page says the home screen will not follow, and the setting is in-app
only.

Android switches icons by having every icon be an `activity-alias` carrying the
`LAUNCHER` filter and enabling exactly one. `MainActivity` therefore has no
`LAUNCHER` filter of its own — with one it would appear on the home screen
twice — and `MainActivity.kt` enables the wanted alias *before* disabling the
others, because an instant with none enabled is one a launcher can read, and it
drops the app off the home screen for good.

The alias is written `.PromptIcon` in the manifest, which Gradle expands against
the **namespace**, not the application id. They are the same string today, so
`MainActivity.kt` derives the class name from its own package rather than from
`packageName`: the two are free to diverge, and if they ever do, a launcher
switch built on `packageName` would name a component that does not exist.

Not behind a conditional import the way `Shell` is: a `MethodChannel` compiles
everywhere and a platform with nothing answering it throws, which is the same
no-op `available` being false gives. So the app still has exactly one
conditional import.

### Setting overrides

A chat's `meta.json` overrides the app default in `settings.json`. Each level
stores `null` to mean "inherit", shown in the UI as the `Default` option —
always first in its list, with a reset button beside the field. Pinning a model
pins its provider too: the registry keys clients by provider id, so the two are
only ever sent as a matched pair.

`Default` is a live reference, not a snapshot: a chat that pins nothing uses
whatever the global default currently is, and retargeting the global retargets
every such chat. With nothing to inherit, the model list stays empty rather than
falling back to a provider — a guessed default would mean something that shifts
as providers come and go.

Both settings pages render the same `ProviderModelSelector`; it owns those
rules, and each page only says where the values come from and where they go.

The title model is the exception: nothing inherits from it, so it is a pair or
it is off, and `OptionalModelPicker` offers every configured model in one list
with `Off` at the top rather than a provider field and a model field. The
classifier model is the same pattern: a separate optional pair, used only by
auto mode, and off by default.

`settings.json`'s `environment` is what every command runs under, and where a
provider that names its key rather than holding it looks. It is read off disk
when used rather than captured at startup, so an edit applies to the next
command. Settings wins over the process's own environment, but a key already
exported is found without having to be pasted in. Old files with the former
`opencodeEnv` key still load, and rewrite themselves under the new name on the
next save.

The settings page is four sections plus deleting everything: **New chats**
(default model, title model), **Appearance** (app icon), **Agent** (command
approval mode, classifier model, providers), **Environment**.

### Shared UI

`lib/ui/widgets/` holds what more than one page needs: `ModelPicker` and
`OptionalModelPicker` (each a field over the model list, sharing the loading and
failure states every page would otherwise spell out) over
`ProviderModelSelector` (which owns every rule about the pair, and is tested
directly in `provider_model_selector_test.dart` rather than through both pages),
the
`Default`-plus-reset pairing, `LabelledField` (a field under its caption) and
`InheritableDropdown` over both (whose first entry stores null and names what
null resolves to), the `promptForText` / `promptForPair` / `confirm` /
`pickProject` dialogs, and `AttachmentChip` /
`AttachmentStrip`. Tests share `test/harness.dart` (`TestApp`, `tempConfig`,
`pumpUntil`, `seedChat` for a chat that is actually listed, the dropdown
finders) and `test/fakes.dart` (`FakeBackend`, whose `scriptedEvents` and `hold`
drive a turn and whose `scriptedTitle` names a chat, plus `FakeAttachmentPicker`
and `testLibrary`).

Streamed deltas are coalesced into one state update per frame: per-token updates
made the reply's text quadratic and rebuilt every visible bubble thousands of
times per turn. One buffer carries both kinds of delta, so switching between
thinking and reply flushes what it held — otherwise the two would fold into each
other's part.

`activity_label.dart` owns the labels and the drawer behind them; the bubble
walks the parts and decides which of the two each one is.

`Composer` opens a menu above the field when the caret sits in a `/` or `@`
token, over a library that is already loaded — so it takes no chat id, has no
loading state, and starts nothing. Enter, Tab and the arrows are bound only
while the menu has a match — the rest of the time they have to keep doing what
they do in a text box. The `+` button left of the field is a second way in: for
a command or an agent it types the trigger character rather than opening its own
list, so both routes share one code path; for a file it opens the chooser.

## Development

- Build/test Linux desktop inside the `flutter-dev` toolbox (host lacks
  cmake/ninja/clang++): `toolbox run --container flutter-dev flutter build linux --debug`.
- UI runs forwarded to host: `toolbox run --container flutter-dev flutter run -d linux --debug`.
- Web: `toolbox run --container flutter-dev flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8087 --web-hostname 127.0.0.1`.
  Nothing runs the app in a browser here, so a web-only regression is caught by
  reloading the page, not by `flutter test`.
- Codegen: `dart run build_runner build` (freezed + json_serializable).
- Analyze: `flutter analyze`. Tests: `flutter test`.

## Dependency note

Freezed 3.x requires `abstract class Foo with _$Foo` (not just `class`).
Build runner capped at `^2.15.1` to stay compatible with freezed 3.2.5's
analyzer constraint. riverpod_generator dropped due to analyzer conflict with
freezed; we use manual Riverpod providers.
